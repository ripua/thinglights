Notes on portability of Simplicity Studio projects:

As per https://www.silabs.com/community/software/simplicity-studio/forum.topic.html/best_way_to_movepro-xx21

After cloning the project you should open the <project name>.isc file and run Generate.
For this particular project though you should NOT replace any of the files.
